<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the project 🚀

The portfolio site kateroshh.ru was created to display information about the frontend developer, display the main projects with their description and the CV (recruiter can download the CV file). The site allows you to switch between Russian and English (this is implemented with the help of Next.js Internationalization, in the first version the data is taken from json files).
